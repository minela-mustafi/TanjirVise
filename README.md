# TanjirVise

TanjirVise is a mobile application that aims to redistribute excess food from restaurants to socially disadvantaged groups with the help of volunteers. The system serves as a bridge between restaurants with surplus food and individuals in need, simultaneously reducing food waste and improving social welfare.
